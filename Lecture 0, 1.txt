1) 
open source -> OSS (open source software) 

OSS : computer program for general public for use or modification, under a software license (example. GPL, MIT, Apache...)
(not necessarily meaning cost-free)

2) 
* always OSS have a copyright (no open source license -> it is not open source)
* not always OSS is cost-free (cost-free OSS == FOSS)
* freeware != open source (mostly) : we cannot read the code in some software's executable file

3) 
OSS example : GNU, Linux, Apache, Libre, Pytorch, Python, Chromium, OpenCV...

4) 
git : version control (capture snapshot)
github : upload the git & withdoing each other

repository, readme, branch...

5) 
GNU : collection of many open programs including Unix-like operation system (GNU/Linus kernel)

Four essential freedoms :
freedom 0 : to run for any purpose
freedom 1 : to study and change program as we you wish
freedom 2 : to redistribute copies
freedom 3 : to distribute copies of the modified versions

6)
License is included in README, comment, document, etc

7)
contribution : modification, comments and other activities to improve OSS
